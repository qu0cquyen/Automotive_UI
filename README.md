		<p>To implement this project. There are some components and equipments are used: 
				<ul>
					<li>Raspberry Pi 4: </li>
					<li>ADS1015 Converter: </li>
					<li>Pulse Sensor - SEN 11574: </li>
					<li>Customized PCB: </li>
					<li>Headers: </li>
					<li></li> 
				</ul>
		</p>
		<li><h3>Time Commitment</h3></li>
		<p>
		&nbsp;The total amount of time to accomplish this project is approximately 20 hours. This included waiting time for all components and equipments are shipped and gathered. For some side-work such as Project Selection (30 minutes), Proposal, Meeting and Budget will take roughly one to two hours to finish each of them. 
		&nbsp;Fritzing software is used to design the Breadboard and PCB. Both designs are pretty straight forward, all we need to do is to properly wire up all the components. However, the software does not include Hearbeat sensor and ADS1015 converter. [Attach files] The design files for this 2 components will be included at the end of this section. [Pictures]. In additional, there are two things we need to adjust for the PCB design are the size of Vias and Wires, 0.9 and 16 mil accordingly. This process should take around 4 hours. 
		&nbsp;After having both designs are done, next all the necessary components will be hooked up on the breadboard first based upon the breadboard designed which is done in Fritizing. The amount of time should be spent on this process is 30 minutes to 1 hour. 
		&nbsp;Assuming, everything is working up until now. PCB power up will be
