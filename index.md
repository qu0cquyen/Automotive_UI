		<p>I have just received my customer Pi case from third party service. However, the results are not what I expected due to the wrong measurement between the holes size and the stands size which make them cannot fit (clip) together. An adjustment of measurements has been made and I am waiting for the next printing results. </p>

		<p>Since there is a significant number of 3D printer reservations, I was not able to use the printer for the maximum two hours. I could only use the printer for one hour in order to print one side of my case. Unfortunately, as the come out result was not what I expected, then I realized that I messed up my measurement as well as the shapes of my case.</p> 
		<p>	Nonetheless, I managed to fix up my design at the moment I am writing this blog. The problem that I am having right now is the amount of time that I have to spend for making my whole case is around 9 hours 30 minutes. This process can be speeded up by printing each part separately, this may save approximate 2 hours compares to the printing the whole case as the original intention. In addition, my design is sent to the prototype lab to have them to help me in printing the physical case. </p>

		<p>	According to the schedule, we are at the PCB power up stage of the project right now. This
		means we are following what we have set for the project schedule. Even though we have dealt with some PCB connectivity problems, we are able to solve the issues and have it functions as we expect under the guidances of the professors in prototype lab. </p>
		<p>	In terms of finance, we have to pay around $20 for the headers which are used to attached and make connections between pins on PCB. The follwing pictures are captured to show the working PCB and running codes: </p>

		<p>Uploads proof of purchasing.</p>
		<p>There is a minor change in purchasing, instead of using the link that I provided in the budget. However, since the component (ADS1015) is going to be delivered in the middle of October, I have to change to another supplier who can deliver the component before the second week of October. A modification has been made in the budget file.</p>
		<h3>September 24th, 2019</h3>
		<p>After searching the suppliers for the components that I need. Then, I build a table with all information of the suppliers, part numbers, price and so forth in this table and named it as Project Budget. </p>

		<h3>September 17th, 2019</h3>
		<p>We had a discussion about the possibilities of finishing the project. Then we finalized how the project schedule should be looked alike.</p>
		<p>Changes the sensor that I am going to use for the project. The sensor that I will use is "Pulsesenor Heart Rate Beat Pulse Sensor Module" with an Analog to Digital converter (ADS1015). <a href='http://udayankumar.com/2016/05/17/heart-beat-raspberry/'>References</a></p>
